Variables
It is location in the memory to store the data.

Variable will be associated with 3 things:
1. Name/Identifier
2. Data/Value  ===> Literal/Input for the user
3. Datatype

Datatypes: Describe the type of the data that can be stored in the memory and also specifies the amount of memory to be allocated to the variable

We have 8 primitive datatypes:
Number (Whole Number) 45,356,24656,2567667,8896
1. byte		1 byte		-128 to 127
2. short 	2 bytes
3. int		4 bytes
4. long		8 bytes

Number (Fractional/Decimal) 78.56,345346.46456
5. float	4 bytes
6. double	8 bytes

Character - single character - a,v
7. char		2 bytes

Boolean - true/false
8. boolean	----

Non-Primitive Datatypes
String 
Array
Object
Enum

Variable Declaration
Syntax:
datatype identifier/name;

or

datatype identifier/name = value;

Literal are the values assigned to the variables

Java is statically-type language, we specify the datatype of the variables before they are can be used.

Rules for naming variable
1. Names are case sensitive
2. Must start either with a letter (a-z,A-Z), underscore or dollar
3. Must not start with the digit
4. Can contain digits,letters,underscore or dollar
5. Must not contain whitespace or special character
6. Choose name that having some meaning
7. Cannot be a keyword/reserved words

Comments
Notes that can be added in the java program. It can also be the code that you don't want to compile in the class file.

1. Single Line Comments (//comment)
2. Multiline Comments (/* comment */)

Operators
Operators are the symbols that preform operation on the variable and values. 
1. Arithmetic Operator
+ Addition
- Subtraction
* Multiplication
/ Division (Quotient)
% Modulus (Remainder after division)

2. Assignment Operator
Used to assign the value to the variable
a = 20;
assign the value 20 on the right of the operator to the variable a that is on left of the operator

Compound Assignment Operator
3. Relational Operator
4. Logical Operator
5. Bitwise Operator

Typecasting
1. Implicit Typecasting: conversion of the value by compiler from one data to another

byte ---> short ---> int ---> long ---> float ---> double
widening

2. Explicit Typecasting: conversion of the value by programmer from one data to another

byte <--- short <--- int <--- long <--- float <--- double
narrowing
