Java Development Kit ===> Programmer 
JDK (Helper file, compiler, jre)

Java Runtime Environment ==> End-User to execute .class
Installed separately

Java Virtual Machine ==> Enable the computer to run the java program (.class)

JVM makes the java application platform-independent but it itself is not platform independent.

For every different OS, JVM created for that OS has to installed in the machine

Conventions ==> not the rules that we have to follows but they are some standards setup by programmers to make the code more readable and understandable

Convention for naming the class name is PascalCase

First Java Program
1. Every Application begins with class definition.
2. Save this file with same name as that of the classname and give the extension as .java
3. Create the main method, starting point from the java application. JVM will start the execution of the program from the main method
4. Print the message to the user on the console screen, we use System.out.println(), we enclose the message in double-quotes
5. Every statement in the java application ends with (;) semi colon

Variables
It is location in the memory to store the data.

Variable will be associated with 3 things:
1. Name/Identifier
2. Data/Value
3. Datatype

Datatypes: Describe the type of the data that can be stored in the memory and also specifies the amount of memory to be allocated to the variable

We have 8 primitive datatypes:
Number (Whole Number) 45,356,24656,2567667,8896
1. byte		1 byte		-128 to 127
2. short 	2 bytes
3. int		4 bytes
4. long		8 bytes

Number (Fractional/Decimal) 78.56,345346.46456
5. float	4 bytes
6. double	8 bytes

Character - single character - a,v
7. char		1 byte

Boolean - true/false
8. boolean	----

Variable Declaration
Syntax:
datatype identifier/name;

or

datatype identifier/name = value;

Literal are the values assigned to the variables
